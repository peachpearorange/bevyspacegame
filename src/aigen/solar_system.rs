// please create your world here in this file. please create a lot of asteroids in space and npcs in various places near space stations. some that talk and some that don't. various space ships and interesting locations. create your own dialogue trees for the npcs. create about 5 planets, 10 zones and 8 npcs with dialogue trees and many more without dialogue trees. All of the zones should be defined inside of { } blocks so you can create local variables for reuseable objects.
